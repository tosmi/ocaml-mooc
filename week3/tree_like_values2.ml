 Tries (40 points possible)

The data structure called trie is very convenient to represent a
dictionary whose keys are strings. It is space-efficient way while
providing a very fast lookup function.

See the page on WikiPedia.

In this exercise, we will implement such a data structure, assuming
that we want to associate integers to the strings of the dictionary.

Let us define a trie using two mutually defined types (given in the prelude):

    trie which represents a trie, that is a tree whose root may
    contain an integer and whose children are indexed by characters ;

    char_to_children which implements the associative data structure
    whose keys are characters and whose values are trie (childrens).

As a trade-off between speed and memory consumption, we choose an
associative list to represent the association between characters and
children.

The prelude also gives examples of empty trie and of another one that contains the following pairs (key, value):

[("A", 15); ("to", 7); ("tea", 3);("ted", 4); ("ten", 12); ("i", 11); ("in", 5); ("inn", 9)].

    Write a function children_from_char : char_to_children -> char -> trie option such that
        children_from_char m c = Some t if (c, t) is the first pair in m with c as a first component ;
        children_from_char m c = None if no such pair exists in m.

    Write a function update_children : char_to_children -> char -> trie -> char_to_children such that
        children_from_char (update_children m c t) c = Some t ;
        children_from_char (update_children m c t) c' = children_from_char m c' for c <> c';
        If children_from_char m c = Some t then List.length (update_children m c t') = List.length m.

    Write a function lookup : trie -> string -> int option such that
    lookup trie w = Some i if i is the value of the key w in trie and
    lookup trie w = None if w is not a key of trie.

    To look for a key in a trie, iterate over the characters of the
    key from left to right. Given the current character c and the
    current node of the trie n, look for the children n for character
    c. If such a children exists, continue with that trie and the
    remainder of the key. If no such children exists, the key is not
    in the trie. When the characters of the key are entirely consumed,
    look at the root of the current trie. If there is an integer, this
    is the value you are looking for. If there is no integer, the key
    not in the trie.

    Write a function insert : trie -> string -> int -> trie such that
    lookup (insert trie w k) w = Some w and lookup (insert trie w k)
    w' = lookup trie w' for w <> w'.
